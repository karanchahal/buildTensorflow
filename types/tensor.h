/*
    This file defines the Tensor class. The Tensor is the base object used for creating 
    neural networks. Each neuron in the network will be a tensor. In this project we will 
    use matrices to represent layers of a neural network, hence each tensor would simply be
    a n dimensional matrix. 
    
    Apart from this the tensor is aware of what operations have been performed with it. This 
    is useful when we want to calculate the gradients of the tensor with respect to some
    other variable (a loss function generally with neural networks).
    To calculate these gradients, the tensor keeps a track of what operations have been 
    performed with it as a operand. 
    
    For now we are assuming that the tensor just goes through one operation, hence we have 
    a frontOp denoting the operation that it is involved in and backOp is the operation that 
    created this tensor.

    To know more about Operations head to the operation module and check out the operation.h
    file.
