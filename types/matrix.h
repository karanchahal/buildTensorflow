    /*
        This function performs the matrix multiplication between a n dimensional matrix and a 2d matrix.
        To view it's usage check the dot() function from where it is called. It is a recursive function
        that calls itself until two 2d matrices have been got. It keeps a track of the position of nd 
        matrix by using a stack. The stack keeps a track of the index of each dimension that has been
        traversed. We use this information to find the index from where to start the 2d matrix 
        multiplication. To find out the index from where to do the  2D matrix multiplication, we shall 
        look into an example:

        Assume we have 2 matrices of shape A = (3,4,2,1) and B = (1,2)
        Assume we are currently at position [2][3] in our lhs matrix.
        C = A[2][3];

        Hence we are ready to do our 2d matrix multiplication as we have two 2d matrices C and B now.
        But since our matrix is stored as a 1d vector , we need to find the index from where to start
        the multiplicatoinn for A.
        The right index would be 2*(num_col_for_dimension_0) + 3*(num_col_for_dimension_1).

        These num cols for each dimension are stored in the elemsEncounteredPerDim vector.
        Hence we use this information to find out the correct starting index of A.

        We use a similiar thing to track the starting index of result vector by computing 
        num_cols_per_dimension in resElems.

        Lastly the dim parameter tracks what the current dimension is. IT start from 0 and keeps 
        on being incremented after each function call.
